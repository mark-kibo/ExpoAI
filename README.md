Welcome to the AI Image Generator project! This application allows graphic designers and creative artists to generate unique images using the power of artificial intelligence. By providing either input text or uploading an image, you can obtain a variety of output images or edited versions in various styles. The project is built using JavaScript (Js) and HTML and utilizes the DALL-E API for image generation.

## Features

- Image Generation: Users can input text descriptions or upload images to the app, and the AI model will generate unique images based on the input.
- Style Transformation: The application offers various image editing options, allowing users to transform images into different styles, colors, or artistic renditions.
- Creativity Boost: Graphic designers and artists can utilize the AI-generated images as a starting point to create compelling and visually appealing designs for various projects.
